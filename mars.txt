# Mars

## Properties pertaining to monster habitability

Mars is cold and dry, but everything is Dracula's favourite colour.
The 2 moons may be a problem for Wolfman,
but the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.

## Properties pertaining to human habitability

We will need to make our own oxygen.
We can get it out of the CO2 as there is heaps of it on the planet Mars.
